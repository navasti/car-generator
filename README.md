### Car Generator
This project consists of a simple api server and an application that uses this api on the page.\
The application was written in React using libraries such as Redux, axios, framer-motion, styled-components while the server is written in Express.

### Getting Started
Before running the application, dependencies must be installed in the main directory and in the app directory.\
In both of these directories, run the command below:
```
npm install
```
Thanks to the concurrently library, the server and the application can be launched with one command.\
While in the main directory, run the following command in the console:
```
npm run dev
```
If everything was successfully launched, the browser should open a new window with an already running application.\
In case this does not happen, the application will be available at this address:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
Enjoy!
